### 🧠 Executive Summary

This project visualizes and analyzes COVID-19 mortality trends in Brazil to identify data-driven anomalies that align with the country’s four major pandemic waves.  

Using a custom anomaly detection framework and hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved **94% alignment** between detected anomalies and documented wave periods, while filtering out minor fluctuations.  

The final high-precision configuration captures only significant epidemiological shifts, improving interpretability and robustness across time.  

This pipeline establishes a scalable foundation for applying anomaly detection to other regions, temporal resolutions, and health indicators in future studies.
